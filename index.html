             <p4><br>Originally hailing from the Philippines, I’ve always been captivated by the power of education to transform lives. This had led me to start my own non-profit organization for agriculture students. </br><br> Fueled by my passion to show up for my first advocacy, I moved to Madrid to teach young children.</br>

<br>I started my career in tech a few years ago as an ops person for a Southeast Asia tech Accelerator, and an e-commerce management company. Currently, I find myself thriving in the fast-paced and thrilling domain of fintech at Parallax.</br>

<br>I believe in the power of technology to create positive and lasting impact. It has been through my experience that I’ve learned the true essence of empathy, collaboration, and continuous learning.</br>

  <br>My mission is to build for a future of limitless possibilities for everyone.</br></p4>
